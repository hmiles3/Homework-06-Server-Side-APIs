# Homework-06-Server-Side-APIs
The goal of this app was to be able to take a city name from the user and return the current weather as well as a five day forecast for that particular city. As far as that part goes, I was able to get everything working, though not perfectly. The most apparent issue being that I had trouble trying to attain the information from the user with a form, so I ended up making a prompt just so that I would still be able to demonstrate that the code is still successfully appending the information for different cities using the API. Another issue, one that I have no explanation for, is that currently whenever I open the link through github, the city's name does not appear at the top where it should even though it does when I open my file locally, despite there being no differences between the two. Also, because I could not figure out how to properly utilize a form, I couldn't do the local storage part of the assignment. I think that betweeen this assignment and the current project, I'm getting the hang of using APIs, but there's definitely some fundamental areas that I'm still struggling with.
